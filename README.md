# EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE FLIGHT OPERATION DATASET
This report provides an in-depth analysis of flight operations across three major airlines (Airline A, Airline B, and Airline C).
By examining key operational metrics such as total revenue, ticket pricing, passenger volume, flight durations, and delay impacts, 
this analysis seeks to uncover insights that can drive better decision-making and improve efficiency in airline operations. 

The data was processed using Excel Pivot Tables and Power BI visualization, with the focus on comparing the performance of these airlines across various routes, 
The total number of flights was 1000 across the month of January and February generating a total revenue of $37,818,213. The average delay time for flights was about 14 minutes. The following insights were generated from the dataset:

1. REVENUE INSIGHTS
